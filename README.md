#### Announcing new region availability: Custom resource auto scaling is now available in the China (Beijing) region.
* * *

In this aws-auto-scaling-custom-resource repository, we demonstrate how to set up automatic scaling for custom resources using AWS services. In this context, a *custom resource* is an object that allows you to introduce your own application or service to the automatic scaling features of AWS.  

The included AWS CloudFormation template launches a collection of AWS resources, including a new Amazon API Gateway endpoint. The API Gateway endpoint allows secure access to scalable resources in the application or service that you want automatic scaling to work with. 

Once everything is deployed and configured, you'll have the following environment in your AWS account.

You can use this repository and the deployment steps below as the starting point for your customizations. More information about this approach to custom resource auto scaling is detailed in this [blog post](https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/auto-scaling-production-services-on-titus-1f3cd49f5cd7).

# Deployment Steps

Follow the step-by-step instructions in this section to build and test the custom resource auto scaling environment in your AWS account. The CloudFormation template provided with this repository creates the core AWS components from scratch. 

## 1. Test your REST Endpoint URL

Before running the CloudFormation template, you need an HTTP/HTTPS endpoint to expose your REST resources. Make sure your application conforms to the REST API specification in the [custom-resource-stack.yaml](https://github.com/aws/aws-auto-scaling-custom-resource/blob/master/cloudformation/templates/custom-resource-stack.yaml) CloudFormation template.  

A sample REST endpoint is provided as a Dockerized Apache Python cgi.   See: [sample-api-server](./sample-api-server/)  

After you create an endpoint that contains the required REST resources, you can verify that the endpoint URL works by issuing GET and PATCH requests to it, for example: 

```
$ curl -i -X GET --header 'Accept: application/json' 'http://api.example.com/v1/scalableTargetDimensions/myservice'
```

If the endpoint is set up properly, it should return a standard 200 OK response message and a payload that represents the requested resource and its status.

The response for GET and PATCH will look something like:

```json
{
  "actualCapacity": 2.0,
  "desiredCapacity": 2.0,
  "dimensionName": "MyDimension",
  "resourceName": "MyService",
  "scalableTargetDimensionId": "1-23456789",
  "scalingStatus": "Successful",
  "version": "MyVersion"
}
```

## 2. Launch the Stack

Download the [custom-resource-stack.yaml](https://github.com/aws/aws-auto-scaling-custom-resource/blob/master/cloudformation/templates/custom-resource-stack.yaml) CloudFormation template from GitHub.

Run the following [create-stack](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudformation/create-stack.html) command, adding your details to the following parameters:

1. *SNSSubscriptionEmail*: Replace *email-address* with an email address to send certificate expiry notifications to.
2. *IntegrationHttpEndpoint*: Replace *endpoint-url* with your REST endpoint URL, for example, http://api.example.com/v1/scalableTargetDimensions/{scalableTargetDimensionId}

Make a note of the AWS [region](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html) where you created this stack. You need it later. Note: The examples in this repository use us-west-2, but the steps will be the same if you deploy into a different region. 

```
$ aws cloudformation create-stack \
    --stack-name CustomResourceAPIGatewayStack \
    --template-body file://~/custom-resource-stack.yaml \
    --region us-west-2 \
    --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM CAPABILITY_IAM \
    --parameters \         
        ParameterKey=SNSSubscriptionEmail,ParameterValue="email-address" \
        ParameterKey=IntegrationHttpEndpoint,ParameterValue='"endpoint-url"'
```
The stack takes only a few minutes to deploy. It creates a new REST API in API Gateway with two stages: “PreProd” and “Prod”. A stage defines the path through which an API deployment is accessible. Each stage is deployed with its own client-side certificate. 

When the deployment has completed successfully, you’ll receive an email to confirm a subscription to the Amazon SNS topic created by the template. Choose the *Confirm subscription* link in the message to subscribe to emails that are sent whenever there is an expiring certificate. A Lambda function checks once a day to see if the client certificate is expiring in 7, 3, or 1 days.

## 3. Get the Resource ID & API Gateway client certificate IDs

To continue with the deployment steps, you need the HTTPS link (aka Resource ID) for your API Gateway endpoint. 

After the stack launches, run the [describe-stacks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudformation/describe-stacks.html) command and copy the output. 

```
$ aws cloudformation describe-stacks --region us-west-2 --stack-name CustomResourceAPIGatewayStack  | jq '.Stacks[0]["Outputs"]'
```

This returns the following response:

```json
[
  {
    "Description": "Application Auto Scaling Resource ID prefix for Preprod",
    "OutputValue": "https://example.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/preprod/scalableTargetDimensions/",
    "OutputKey": "PreProdResourceIdPrefix"
  },
  {
    "OutputValue": "customresourceapigatewaystack-s3bucket-ha8id2l1wpo6",
    "OutputKey": "S3BucketName"
  },
  {
    "Description": "Application Auto Scaling Resource ID prefix for Prod",
    "OutputValue": "https://example.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/prod/scalableTargetDimensions/",
    "OutputKey": "ProdResourceIdPrefix"
  },
 {
    "Description": "API Gateway Client Cert",
    "OutputKey": "PreProdClientCertificate",
    "OutputValue": "tt3rdw"
  },
  {
    "Description": "API Gateway Client Cert",
    "OutputKey": "ProdClientCertificate",
    "OutputValue": "frw3tnx"
  }
]
```

The Resource ID has the following syntax:
`[OutputValue][identifier]`

The `OutputValue` is one of the HTTPS prefixes ("Prod" or "Preprod") from the `describe-stacks` output. 

The identifier is a string that identifies a scalable resource in your backend system (the value for *scalableTargetDimensionId* in step 1). 

**Example: Resource ID where “1-23456789” is the identifier in your backend system**

`https://example.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/prod/scalableTargetDimensions/1-23456789`

## 4. Configure SSL/HTTPS  

To configure the SSL/HTTPS connection between the API Gateway and your backend system, you need to download the ProdClientCertificate and PreProdClientCertificate from API Gateway.

Get the `API Gateway Client Cert` Outputvalue(s) from the describe-stacks command from the previous step.

Pass the following cli commands, replacing the `client-certificate-id` with your own, and save the certificate output.

`aws apigateway get-client-certificate --client-certificate-id frw3tnx --output text`

`aws apigateway get-client-certificate --client-certificate-id tt3rdw --output text`

For more information, see [Use Client-Side SSL Certificates for Authentication by the Backend](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/getting-started-client-side-ssl-authentication.html) in the *Amazon API Gateway Developer Guide*.


## 5. Test the API Gateway Integration

The next step is to verify that the API in API Gateway is integrated with your application. The [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) app is a convenient testing tool for this because it provides fields for adding your signing information to the HTTPS request.

Follow the instructions in [Use Postman to Call an API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/how-to-use-postman-to-call-api.html) to send a test request in Postman. You can convert the response to CURL using the code snippet generator to view the headers and body, if desired. The responses for GET and PATCH requests should be similar to the response displayed in step 1. 

For a GET request, the Postman CURL response will look something like:

``` 
curl -X GET \ https://example.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/prod/scalableTargetDimensions/1-23456789 \
  -H 'Authorization: AWS4-HMAC-SHA256 Credential=example/20180704/us-west-2/execute-api/aws4_request, SignedHeaders=content-type;host;x-amz-date;x-amz-security-token, Signature=SIGNATURE' \
  -H 'Cache-Control: no-cache' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
  -H 'Host: example.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com' \
  -H 'Postman-Token: POSTMANTOKEN' \
  -H 'X-Amz-Date: 20180704T023500Z' \
  -H 'X-Amz-Security-Token: SESSIONTOKEN'
{
  "actualCapacity": 2.0,
  "desiredCapacity": 2.0,
  "dimensionName": "MyDimension",
  "resourceName": "MyService",
  "scalableTargetDimensionId": "1-23456789",
  "scalingStatus": "Successful",
  "version": "MyVersion"
}
```

## 6. Register a Scalable Target

You will now register your resource's capacity as a scalable target with Application Auto Scaling. A scalable target is a resource that Application Auto Scaling can scale out or scale in.

Note: Be sure to use the correct permissions when registering a scalable target, so that the [service-linked role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/application/userguide/application-autoscaling-service-linked-roles.html) is automatically created. Otherwise, the scaling function will not work. 

Before you register your scalable target, you'll need to run the following command to save the Resource ID in a txt file (with no newline character at the end of the file). Provide the Resource ID from step 4. 

The command will look like this, but with your Resource ID:

```
$ echo -n "https://example.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/prod/scalableTargetDimensions/1-23456789" > ~/custom-resource-id.txt
```

This saves the file as `custom-resource-id.txt` in your home directory. You can now use the [register-scalable-target](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/application-autoscaling/register-scalable-target.html) command to register your scalable target:

```
$ aws application-autoscaling register-scalable-target --service-namespace custom-resource --scalable-dimension custom-resource:ResourceType:Property --resource-id file://~/custom-resource-id.txt --min-capacity 0 --max-capacity 10
```

This registers your scalable target with Application Auto Scaling, and allows it to manage capacity, but only within the range of 0 to 10 capacity units. 

## 7. Create a Scaling Policy

In this step, you create a sample scaling policy for your custom resource that specifies how the scalable target should be scaled when CloudWatch alarms are triggered. 

For example, for target tracking, you define a target tracking scaling policy that meets your resource's specific requirements by creating a custom metric. You can define a custom metric based on any metric that changes in proportion to scaling.

Not all metrics work for target tracking. The metric must be a valid utilization metric, and it must describe how busy your custom resource is. The value of the metric must increase or decrease in inverse proportion to the number of capacity units. That is, the value of the metric should decrease when capacity increases. 

The following cat command creates a sample metric for your scalable target in a `config.json` file in your home directory:

```
$ cat ~/config.json
{
   "TargetValue":50,
   "CustomizedMetricSpecification":{
      "MetricName":"MyAverageUtilizationMetric",
      "Namespace":"MyNamespace",
      "Dimensions":[
         {
            "Name":"MyMetricDimensionName",
            "Value":"MyMetricDimensionValue"
         }
      ],
      "Statistic":"Average",
      "Unit":"Percent"
   }
}
```

Use the following [put-scaling-policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/application-autoscaling/put-scaling-policy.html) command, along with the `config.json` file you created previously, to create a scaling policy named `custom-tt-scaling-policy` that keeps the average utilization of your custom resource at 50 percent:

```
$ aws application-autoscaling put-scaling-policy \
--policy-name custom-tt-scaling-policy \
--policy-type TargetTrackingScaling \
--service-namespace custom-resource \
--scalable-dimension custom-resource:ResourceType:Property \
--resource-id file://~/custom-resource-id.txt \
--target-tracking-scaling-policy-configuration file://~/config.json
{
    "Alarms": [
        {
            "AlarmName": "TargetTracking-https://example.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/prod/scalableTargetDimensions/1-23456789-AlarmHigh-b9d32d65-78bb-4d01-8931-d67d10f87052",
            "AlarmARN": "arn:aws:cloudwatch:us-west-2:544955126770:alarm:TargetTracking-https://example.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/prod/scalableTargetDimensions/1-23456789-AlarmHigh-b9d32d65-78bb-4d01-8931-d67d10f87052"
        },
        {
            "AlarmName": "TargetTracking-https://example.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/prod/scalableTargetDimensions/1-23456789-AlarmLow-a9f90ec7-dccd-4a66-83ea-26bf3f0134dc",
            "AlarmARN": "arn:aws:cloudwatch:us-west-2:544955126770:alarm:TargetTracking-https://example.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/prod/scalableTargetDimensions/1-23456789-AlarmLow-a9f90ec7-dccd-4a66-83ea-26bf3f0134dc"
        }
    ],
    "PolicyARN": "arn:aws:autoscaling:us-west-2:544955126770:scalingPolicy:ac852aff-b04f-427d-a80a-3e7ef31d492d:resource/custom-resource/https://example.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/prod/scalableTargetDimensions/1-23456789:policyName/custom-tt-scaling-policy"
}
```

This creates two alarms: one for scaling out and one for scaling in. It also returns the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the policy that is registered with CloudWatch, which CloudWatch uses to invoke scaling whenever the metric is in breach. 

You can find additional information about custom metrics in the CloudWatch documentation under [Publish Custom Metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/publishingMetrics.html).

## 8. Test the Scaling Policy 

Now you can test your scaling policy by publishing sample metric data to CloudWatch. CloudWatch alarms will trigger the scaling policy and calculate the scaling adjustment based on the metric and the target value. To do this, you will run a bash script. 

Type the following command to run the bash script:

```bash
// Command to put metric data that breaches AlarmHigh
$ while sleep 3
do
  aws cloudwatch put-metric-data --metric-name MyAverageUtilizationMetric --namespace MyNamespace --value 70 --unit Percent --dimensions MyMetricDimensionName=MyMetricDimensionValue
  echo -n "."
done
```
It may take a few minutes before your scaling policy is invoked. When the target ratio exceeds 50 percent for a sustained period of time, Application Auto Scaling notifies your custom resource to adjust capacity upward, so that the 50 percent target utilization can be maintained.

## 9. View Application Auto Scaling Actions

In this step, you view the Application Auto Scaling actions that are initiated on your behalf.

Run the [describe-scaling-activities](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/application-autoscaling/describe-scaling-activities.html) command:

```
$ aws application-autoscaling describe-scaling-activities --service-namespace custom-resource --resource-id file://~/custom-resource-id.txt --max-results 20
```

You should eventually see output that looks like this: 
```JSON
{
    "ScalingActivities": [
        {
            "ScalableDimension": "custom-resource:ResourceType:Property",
            "Description": "Setting desired capacity to 6.",
            "ResourceId": "https://example.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/prod/scalableTargetDimensions/1-23456789",
            "ActivityId": "2fca0873-3e4d-4c05-a83d-40c6394e6b9b",
            "StartTime": 1530744698.087,
            "ServiceNamespace": "custom-resource",
            "EndTime": 1530744730.766,
            "Cause": "monitor alarm TargetTracking-https://example.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/prod/scalableTargetDimensions/1-23456789-AlarmHigh-b9d32d65-78bb-4d01-8931-d67d10f87052 in state ALARM triggered policy custom-tt-scaling-policy",
            "StatusMessage": "Successfully set desired capacity to 6. Change successfully fulfilled by custom-resource.",
            "StatusCode": "Successful"
        }
    ]
}
```
If you are using the [sample-api-server](./sample-api-server/) provided in this project, you can also see the scaling events in the API log.  

Once you've viewed the scaling activity and verified scaling works, you can press Ctrl+C to stop the bash script.
